# ArduinoProject
 This is an Arduino project for making movement to Servo motor with a joystick and fetching the angle of Servo.
 
 Also the project includes RTC, SD Card Module and 2x16 LCD Display.
 
 In the code you can see them. All you should do is pinning them to Arduino.
 
 What the project does is when you make a movement with a joystick, it writes the angle and real-time clock on the LCD Display and saving data at the SD Card.
